For renders debug purposes, we could use the following approaches:

- Chrome DevTools - [Profiler](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/evaluate-performance/) with "Why did this render" feature
- [Profiler API](https://reactjs.org/docs/profiler.html)
- [why-did-you-render](https://github.com/welldone-software/why-did-you-render) package
- [arePropsEqualDebug](https://gist.github.com/mackankowski/53843a02399f4dbac5b972624c24dc6b) helper function
